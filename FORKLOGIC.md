# Fork Logic: Structured Conviction-Based Trading

ForkLogic is the core methodology behind ForkBot’s alert system — a structured, strategic approach to trading options with precision. It allows traders to prepare multiple "forks" — scenario branches — based on key macro or technical triggers.

## 🧠 Core Idea
Every fork represents a **binary outcome path** based on a market event, catalyst, or level. Instead of reacting to the market, ForkLogic **preplans logic trees** for how price might react and what actions to take in each branch.

## 🔢 Fork Anatomy
Each fork includes:
- 🎯 Trigger Level (e.g. SPY 530 or TSLA 320)
- ✅ Trade Type (0DTE, Weekly, Swing, LEAP)
- 🧩 Entry Plan (Option strike, cost target, sizing)
- 📉 Bearish Scenario
- 📈 Bullish Scenario
- 🧠 Optional: Neutral/No-Play condition

## 💡 Why ForkLogic Matters
Most traders react to the market emotionally.
ForkLogic makes the trader a **planner**, not a guesser.
It minimizes hesitation and maximizes conviction.

## 🔧 Implementation
- Forks are manually planned nightly
- Uploaded or input into ForkBot
- When a TradingView alert is triggered, ForkBot posts the prebuilt alert to Discord
- Supports rapid execution based on conviction level

## 📌 Use Case

"TSLA rejected at 333 — High conviction fade → Buy 310p @ 0.10"

"Planned fork ahead of time: If price rejects under 333, enter downside leg — scale out at 320, 316"

"310p ran from 0.10 → 0.60 in under an hour — clean execution off preloaded fork"


## 🏆 Result
You trade with speed and clarity like an algorithm — but with human-level instinct and macro awareness.
